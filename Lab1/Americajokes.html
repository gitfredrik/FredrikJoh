	<h1>3 jokes about America</h1>
	<p>Americans do not dislike telling other people about how great America is. Some agree and I agree America seems nice and I'd like to go there but still I find America-jokes realy funny.</p>

	<p>None of the jokes are going to be about Donald Trump but many people think about him today when they think about America</p>
	<h2>Wanktional anthem???</h2>
	<p>
		I had to go see my doctor today because I’m having an unusual problem. I say to him, "I’ve got a problem, every time I finish masturbating I sing the American national anthem".

		The doctor said, “Don’t worry, a lot of wankers sing that".

	<h2>One language</h2>
	<p>
		If someone who speaks two languages is bilingual, and someone who speaks many languages is multilingual, then what do you call someone who speaks one language?

		An American.

	<h2>American beer in a canoe</h2>
	<p>
		What do sex in a canoe and American beer have in common? They’re both fucking close to water.
